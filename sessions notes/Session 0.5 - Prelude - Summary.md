# Session 0.5 - Prelude - Summary
An earthquake brought chaos to the town of Sharpstone. The characters were in the Flint & Steel Inn when the disaster occured and the innkeeper Nodruk Landstone, overseer of the town council, offers a reward if the characters can help out around town (which the PC accepted to help anyway without any reward more than the honor of helping) . They saved a family from a collapsing house, saved some explosive liquid (so someone told them about this lady Cornelia Nostra was owning this warehouse and this liquid) from the warehouse in flames and stopped a curse on a damaged Mosoleum. Putting for good a Ghoul into its grave. (Did I mention the unicorn? ðŸ™‚ ) 

After this exhausting day, the characters learn from a group of scouts, that the earthquake has opened the ancient dwarven fortress of Hardflint Hall. 

As an ancestor of the dwarves, Nodruk asks the characters to check out the ruins, but suggests they first gather much-needed supplies in Firford.
