## <a name='Session0.5-Prelude-Summary'></a>Session 0.5 - Prelude - Summary

![Firford Forest](img/Header_Chapter%201.png)

An earthquake brought chaos to the town of Sharpstone. The characters were in the Flint & Steel Inn when the disaster occured and the innkeeper Nodruk Landstone, overseer of the town council, offers a reward if the characters can help out around town (which the PC accepted to help anyway without any reward more than the honor of helping) . They saved a family from a collapsing house, saved some explosive liquid (so someone told them about this lady Cornelia Nostra was owning this warehouse and this liquid) from the warehouse in flames and stopped a curse on a damaged Mosoleum. Putting for good a Ghoul into its grave. (Did I mention the unicorn? ðŸ™‚ ) 

After this exhausting day, the characters learn from a group of scouts, that the earthquake has opened the ancient dwarven fortress of Hardflint Hall. 

As an ancestor of the dwarves, Nodruk asks the characters to check out the ruins, but suggests they first gather much-needed supplies in Firford.

The earthquake has opened the ancient fortress of Hardflint Hall, but it's been hard to get a lot of information on this fortress, seems to bound to a lot of taboos and secrets from the dwarves still alive. The characters were sent by Nodruk to collect the required supplies to get to Hardflint Hall, climbing kits etc...

The travel was a bit hectic, the ferry boat got stuck middle of the water, commoners thrown over board and started to be attacked by aggressive fishs... Fortunately, Pip, Errol and Morlan rescued all the folks, killing the fishs and unblocking the ferryboat onto their destination of Firford.

When discussing with Dock Master Hargreaves, realised not all the supplies were delivered yet, they went on investigating to find her courrier Cherry Halbarrel stuck in a suspended cocoon... guarded by Giant Spiders. Smart and lucky decisions, the spiders were quickly eliminated and the characters could get back to Firford in no time.

When helping Cherry get her deliveries to Firford, they could have access to :

* Crate One: Six quivers and six bolt cases, each
filled with 20 arrows or bolts respectively.
* Crate Two: Two vials of antitoxin, two of per- fume, four flasks of oil, and three bottles of ink. These smash if the crate isnâ€™t lowered safely.
* Crate Three: Three bags of ball bearings (1,000 per bag), three bags of caltrops (20 per bag), and one hunting trap.
* Crate Four: Five climberâ€™s kits, five grappling hooks, ten pitons, and five 50-feet lengths of hempen rope.
* Crate Five: One crowbar, one sledgehammer, one minerâ€™s pick, and ten torches.
* Crate Six: One hundred candles.

Each character will have a climbing kit and whatever tool they can grab from this list above.

Pip also got his hand a vial of antitoxin without anyone noticing...

The characters haven't learn more about this fortress, but maybe some of the ancestors who have lived through this time are still alive in Sharpstone. Why was this fortress sealed shut? Why is that so worrying for Nodruk?

Now, time is ticking, they need to reach Hardflint Hall...

## Session 2 - Back to Sharpstone
